    "Body": `<p>“All hope abandon ye who enter here.”</p>
    <p>That’s the inscription on the gate to Hell in one of the first English translations of The Divine Comedy, by Henry Francis
        Cary, in 1814. You probably know it as the less tongue-twisting “Abandon hope all ye who enter here,” which is the
        epigraph for Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho, hangs as a warning above the entrance to the Disney theme park
        ride Pirates of the Caribbean, appears in the videogame World of Warcraft, and has been repurposed as a lyric by
        The Gaslight Anthem.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>You may have never read a single line of The Divine Comedy, and yet you’ve been influenced by it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But it’s just one line of the 14,233 that make up The Divine Comedy, the three-part epic poem published in 1320 by Florentine
        bureaucrat turned visionary storyteller Dante Alighieri. Literary ambition seems to have been with Dante, born in
        1265, from early in life when he wished to become a pharmacist. In late 13th Century Florence, books were sold in
        apothecaries, a testament to the common notion that words on paper or parchment could affect minds with their ideas
        as much as any drug.</p>
    <p>And what an addiction The Divine Comedy inspired: a literary work endlessly adapted, pinched from, referenced and remixed,
        inspiring painters and sculptors for centuries. More than the authors of the Bible itself, Dante provided us with
        the vision of Hell that remains with us and has been painted by Botticelli and Blake, Delacroix and Dalí, turned
        into sculpture by Rodin – whose The Kiss depicts Dante’s damned lovers Paolo and Francesca – and illustrated in the
        pages of X-Men comics by John Romita. Jorge Luis Borges said The Divine Comedy is “the best book literature has ever
        achieved”, while TS Eliot summed up its influence thus: “Dante and Shakespeare divide the world between them. There
        is no third.” Perhaps the epigraph to The Divine Comedy itself should be “Gather inspiration all ye who enter here.”</p>
    <p>But it’s not just as a fountainhead of inspiration for writers and visual artists that The Divine Comedy reigns supreme
        – this is the work that enshrined what we think of as the Italian language and advanced the idea of the author as
        a singular creative voice with a vision powerful enough to stand alongside Holy Scripture, a notion that paved the
        way for the Renaissance, for the Reformation after that and finally for the secular humanism that dominates intellectual
        discourse today. You may have never read a single line of The Divine Comedy, and yet you’ve been influenced by it.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>To Hell and back</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Dante narrates The Divine Comedy in the first person as his own journey to Hell and Purgatory by way of his guide Virgil,
        the poet of Roman antiquity who wrote the Aeneid, and then to Heaven, led by his ideal woman Beatrice, a fellow Florentine
        for whom he felt romantic longing but who died at a very young age. Right there that suggests this view of the afterlife
        is coloured by authorial wish-fulfillment: Dante gets a personal tour from his father-figure of a literary hero and
        the woman on whom he had a crush. In the parlance of contemporary genre writing, Dante’s version of himself in The
        Divine Comedy is a Mary Sue, a character written to be who the author wishes he could be, having experiences he wishes
        he could have. Sandra Newman, author of How Not to Write a Novel,
        <a href="https://twitter.com/sannewman/status/962509239116881920">has said that</a> “The Divine Comedy is really a typical science fiction trilogy. Book one, a classic. Book two,
        less exciting version of book one. Book three, totally bonkers, unwanted insights into author’s sexuality, Mary Sue’s
        mask slipping in every scene.”</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The entire history of Western literature and theology is Dante’s fodder to sample and mash up like some kind of 14th-Century
            hip-hop artist.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Dante’s biases inform much about how we see Hell, Purgatory and Heaven. And he mixes Christian theology and pagan Greco-Roman
        myth as if both are simultaneously true – or rather, to use another term from contemporary sci-fi/fantasy writing,
        he “retcons” Greco-Roman myth so that its characters, including the gods, can co-exist with Christianity in a way
        that makes logical sense. Charon, the Greek mythological figure who ferries souls to the underworld, now ferries
        the damned to Hell. Satan himself is referred to as Dis, another name for Pluto, the god of the underworld.</p>
    <p>And real-world history is placed alongside divinity too: who is Satan eternally devouring? Judas, the betrayer of Christ,
        in one of his three mouths, yes. But Brutus and Cassius, the betrayers of Julius Caesar, are in his other two mouths.
        Dante is indeed suggesting that Julius Caesar may have been on the same level of importance as Jesus. The entire
        history of Western literature and theology is Dante’s fodder to sample and mash up like some kind of 14th-Century
        hip-hop artist.</p>

    <p>All these references to history, myth and scripture end up being rhetorical ammunition for Dante to comment on the politics
        of his day, the way some of us might invoke, say, instantly recognisable gifs from movies or TV shows to make sense
        of what’s happening in our world now. Suddenly, while in Heaven, the Byzantine Emperor Justinian appears and adds
        his two florins about the French king Charles of Valois, who was trying to undermine the Holy Roman Empire by lending
        military muscle to the papacy: “Let young Charles not think the Lord/Will change his eagle-bearing coat of arms/For
        sprays of lilies, nor that a toy sword/And putty shield will work like lucky charms”. That, via the 2013 translation
        of Clive James, was a personal score for Dante to settle as well, since the forces that had aligned with Charles
        had had him exiled from Florence – for almost the last 20 years of his life he was barred from his beloved city.</p>

    <p>And my, there’s more score settling in The Divine Comedy than in every episode of every Real Housewives series combined.
        His wish for Pisa is the drowning of its “every soul”. In the same canto, he adds, also via James, “Ah, Genoese,
        you that know all the ropes/Of deep corruption yet know not the first/Thing of good custom, how are you not flung/Out
        of this world?” Of the mythical King Midas he says: “And now forever all men fight for air laughing at him.” There
        has never been a more artful master of the insult.</p>
  
    <p>There’s also never been an imagination more attuned to inventive forms of punishment. Barrators, the term for politicians
        who are open to taking bribes, are stuck in hot pitch because they had sticky fingers when they were alive. Caiaphas,
        the high priest who helped condemn Christ, is himself crucified. Pisa’s Count Ugolino is allowed to forever gnaw
        on the neck of Archbishop Ruggieri, the man who condemned him and his sons to die of starvation.</p>

    'Title': 'The Book of Songs: Poems that helped shape Chinese thought',
    'Author': 'Martin Kern',

    'Body': `<p>Since antiquity, no other text has enjoyed a presence quite like The Book of Songs – in one critic’s words, it is “the classic of the human heart and the human mind.” It is the first poetic anthology of China; Confucius himself is said to have compiled the “three hundred songs”—another early name for the text – out of a body of 3,000, “removing duplicates and choosing only what could be matched to the principles of ritual”. By the end of the Western Han dynasty (202 BCE-9 CE), there were no fewer than four schools of the Songsat the imperial academy, offering a range of different interpretations for each song.</p>
    <p>In the same way that Homer’s epics took hold within the West, The Book of Songs played a role in spheres far beyond literature, with a lasting influence on Chinese civilisation. The collection had an impact on education, politics and communal life: in antiquity, the Songs were quoted and recited as coded communication in diplomatic exchange; invoked as proof to cap a philosophical argument; read as commentary – satirical more often than not – on historical circumstances; and taught for the purposes of moral edification. It has continued to affect Chinese society since then, both through what the Songs say and the form they take.</p>
    <blockquote>Many of the Court Hymns are grand, expansive narratives to celebrate the Zhou; they served as the dynasty’s core text of political and cultural memory </blockquote>
    <p>The received anthology emerged from the “Mao tradition”, one of the four early schools, and is divided into four parts: 160 Airs (guofeng), 74 Minor Court Hymns (xiaoya), 31 Major Court Hymns (daya), and 40 Eulogies (song). Within the Eulogies, the 31 Eulogies of Zhou are considered the oldest segment of the anthology, purportedly dating back to the very early years of the Western Zhou (1046-771 BCE) dynasty.</p>
    <p>These hymns, all of them rather short, were performed in sacrifices to the Zhou royal ancestors: multimedia performances containing the aromatic offerings of meat, grain and alcohol; ritual music on drums and bells, wind and string instruments; dance to re-enact the military conquest of the previous Shang dynasty; and the solemn hymns by which the Zhou king praised his ancestors and requested their blessings in return. In short, Chinese poetry begins in religious ritual.</p>
    <p>By accompanying rites, in turn, the Eulogies helped regulate social order. Respecting ‘heaven’s will’ was an important element of ancient Chinese politics; by enforcing this message, the Book of Songs could underpin the rule of the Zhou Dynasty. Unlike the Eulogies, many of the Court Hymns are grand, expansive narratives to celebrate the Zhou; they served as the dynasty’s core text of political and cultural memory. Like the archaic Eulogies, the Hymns are straightforward; there is no debate about the story they are meant to tell.</p>`,
