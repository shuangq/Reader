    <p>That’s the inscription on the gate to Hell in one of the first English translations of The Divine Comedy, by Henry Francis
        Cary, in 1814. You probably know it as the less tongue-twisting “Abandon hope all ye who enter here,” which is the
        epigraph for Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho, hangs as a warning above the entrance to the Disney theme park
        ride Pirates of the Caribbean, appears in the videogame World of Warcraft, and has been repurposed as a lyric by
        The Gaslight Anthem.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>You may have never read a single line of The Divine Comedy, and yet you’ve been influenced by it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But it’s just one line of the 14,233 that make up The Divine Comedy, the three-part epic poem published in 1320 by Florentine
        bureaucrat turned visionary storyteller Dante Alighieri. Literary ambition seems to have been with Dante, born in
        1265, from early in life when he wished to become a pharmacist. In late 13th Century Florence, books were sold in
        apothecaries, a testament to the common notion that words on paper or parchment could affect minds with their ideas
        as much as any drug.</p>
    <p>And what an addiction The Divine Comedy inspired: a literary work endlessly adapted, pinched from, referenced and remixed,
        inspiring painters and sculptors for centuries. More than the authors of the Bible itself, Dante provided us with
        the vision of Hell that remains with us and has been painted by Botticelli and Blake, Delacroix and Dalí, turned
        into sculpture by Rodin – whose The Kiss depicts Dante’s damned lovers Paolo and Francesca – and illustrated in the
        pages of X-Men comics by John Romita. Jorge Luis Borges said The Divine Comedy is “the best book literature has ever
        achieved”, while TS Eliot summed up its influence thus: “Dante and Shakespeare divide the world between them. There
        is no third.” Perhaps the epigraph to The Divine Comedy itself should be “Gather inspiration all ye who enter here.”</p>

    <p>But it’s not just as a fountainhead of inspiration for writers and visual artists that The Divine Comedy reigns supreme
        – this is the work that enshrined what we think of as the Italian language and advanced the idea of the author as
        a singular creative voice with a vision powerful enough to stand alongside Holy Scripture, a notion that paved the
        way for the Renaissance, for the Reformation after that and finally for the secular humanism that dominates intellectual
        discourse today. You may have never read a single line of The Divine Comedy, and yet you’ve been influenced by it.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>To Hell and back</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Dante narrates The Divine Comedy in the first person as his own journey to Hell and Purgatory by way of his guide Virgil,
        the poet of Roman antiquity who wrote the Aeneid, and then to Heaven, led by his ideal woman Beatrice, a fellow Florentine
        for whom he felt romantic longing but who died at a very young age. Right there that suggests this view of the afterlife
        is coloured by authorial wish-fulfillment: Dante gets a personal tour from his father-figure of a literary hero and
        the woman on whom he had a crush. In the parlance of contemporary genre writing, Dante’s version of himself in The
        Divine Comedy is a Mary Sue, a character written to be who the author wishes he could be, having experiences he wishes
        he could have. Sandra Newman, author of How Not to Write a Novel,
        <a href="https://twitter.com/sannewman/status/962509239116881920">has said that</a> “The Divine Comedy is really a typical science fiction trilogy. Book one, a classic. Book two,
        less exciting version of book one. Book three, totally bonkers, unwanted insights into author’s sexuality, Mary Sue’s
        mask slipping in every scene.”</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The entire history of Western literature and theology is Dante’s fodder to sample and mash up like some kind of 14th-Century
            hip-hop artist.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Dante’s biases inform much about how we see Hell, Purgatory and Heaven. And he mixes Christian theology and pagan Greco-Roman
        myth as if both are simultaneously true – or rather, to use another term from contemporary sci-fi/fantasy writing,
        he “retcons” Greco-Roman myth so that its characters, including the gods, can co-exist with Christianity in a way
        that makes logical sense. Charon, the Greek mythological figure who ferries souls to the underworld, now ferries
        the damned to Hell. Satan himself is referred to as Dis, another name for Pluto, the god of the underworld.</p>

    <p>And real-world history is placed alongside divinity too: who is Satan eternally devouring? Judas, the betrayer of Christ,
        in one of his three mouths, yes. But Brutus and Cassius, the betrayers of Julius Caesar, are in his other two mouths.
        Dante is indeed suggesting that Julius Caesar may have been on the same level of importance as Jesus. The entire
        history of Western literature and theology is Dante’s fodder to sample and mash up like some kind of 14th-Century
        hip-hop artist.</p>

    <p>All these references to history, myth and scripture end up being rhetorical ammunition for Dante to comment on the politics
        of his day, the way some of us might invoke, say, instantly recognisable gifs from movies or TV shows to make sense
        of what’s happening in our world now. Suddenly, while in Heaven, the Byzantine Emperor Justinian appears and adds
        his two florins about the French king Charles of Valois, who was trying to undermine the Holy Roman Empire by lending
        military muscle to the papacy: “Let young Charles not think the Lord/Will change his eagle-bearing coat of arms/For
        sprays of lilies, nor that a toy sword/And putty shield will work like lucky charms”. That, via the 2013 translation
        of Clive James, was a personal score for Dante to settle as well, since the forces that had aligned with Charles
        had had him exiled from Florence – for almost the last 20 years of his life he was barred from his beloved city.</p>

    <p>And my, there’s more score settling in The Divine Comedy than in every episode of every Real Housewives series combined.
        His wish for Pisa is the drowning of its “every soul”. In the same canto, he adds, also via James, “Ah, Genoese,
        you that know all the ropes/Of deep corruption yet know not the first/Thing of good custom, how are you not flung/Out
        of this world?” Of the mythical King Midas he says: “And now forever all men fight for air laughing at him.” There
        has never been a more artful master of the insult.</p>

    <p>There’s also never been an imagination more attuned to inventive forms of punishment. Barrators, the term for politicians
        who are open to taking bribes, are stuck in hot pitch because they had sticky fingers when they were alive. Caiaphas,
        the high priest who helped condemn Christ, is himself crucified. Pisa’s Count Ugolino is allowed to forever gnaw
        on the neck of Archbishop Ruggieri, the man who condemned him and his sons to die of starvation.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>The turn of the spheres</strong>
    </p>
    <p>These are stunning images, but made all the more powerful by the language in which Dante chose to convey them: not Latin,
        the language of all serious literary works in Italy to that point, but Florentine Tuscan. In the early 14th Century,
        Italy, a patchwork of city states with various external imperial powers vying for influence, was also a patchwork
        of different languages. Writing in the Florentine dialect of the Tuscan language could have limited the appeal of
        The Divine Comedy. But the work proved so popular, so endlessly read, that the literate in Italy adapted themselves
        to, or strained to learn, Florentine Tuscan in order to appreciate it in Dante’s own tongue. (It helped that he also
        incorporated, where appropriate, elements of other local dialects as well as Latin expressions, to widen its appeal.)</p>

    <p>Florentine Tuscan became the lingua franca of Italy as a result of The Divine Comedy, helping to establish Florence as
        the creative hub of the Renaissance. It also became the language in which Dante’s literary descendants Boccaccio
        and Petrarch would write – eventually just known as Italian. Through the force of his words, Dante helped create
        the very idea of the Italian language that is spoken today.</p>

    <p>Writing in the vernacular, and helping to create a new vernacular for much of Italy, allowed Dante’s ideas to take wide
        root – and helped set the stage for the intellectual revolutions to come in the Renaissance, Reformation and Enlightenment.
        Two centuries later, Protestant leaders would advocate that reading the Bible in your own vernacular meant that you
        could give it your own individual understanding, undermining the idea that salvation is possible only through the
        Roman Church – something Dante himself had already done by outright inventing elements of the cosmology he presents
        in The Divine Comedy.</p>

    <p>He had the presumption to fill in what the Bible leaves out. And, setting the stage for the Renaissance and its rebirth
        of Classical learning, Dante’s idea of Hell draws from Aristotle’s view that reason is the most important thing in
        life – which would be the later idea in Protestantism that an individual’s reason is their path to salvation. Each
        circle of Hell, and the Seven Deadly Sins assigned to them along with a few other categories, is classified based
        on either failures of reason (the lesser crimes, in which primal impulses overwhelm intellect, such as lust, gluttony,
        greed and sloth) or outright, conscious assaults on reason (such as fraud and malice, which are the direst crimes
        in Hell and for whom the damned are placed in the lowest, darkest circles).</p>
    <p>Beyond Dante’s suggestion that faith in Christ through reason is the key to salvation, not the sacraments of the Church,
        it’s hard to think of a literary work so powerfully condemnatory of so many aspects of Roman Catholicism that exists
        before The Divine Comedy. He deplores the Church’s sale of indulgences and imagines many popes damned to Hell, with
        an entire line of 13th- and early 14th-Century pontiffs doomed to burn in an eternal flame for the crime of simony
        (the buying or selling of ecclesiastical privileges) until the pope following them dies and takes their place in
        the scorching. Dante also has a surprisingly global outlook, one quite fair to non-Christians. He heaps praise on
        the Saracen general Saladin, who he imagines merely occupying a place in Limbo, the place where the Just live who
        did not have faith in Christ in their lifetimes. There’s even a suggestion that there can be exceptions for those
        who did not know Christ but were Just, allowing them to ascend to Heaven.</p>
    <p>The Divine Comedy is a fulcrum in Western history. It brings together literary and theological expression, pagan and
        Christian, that came before it while also containing the DNA of the modern world to come. It may not hold the meaning
        of life, but it is Western literature’s very own theory of everything.</p>

    'Title': 'The Book of Songs: Poems that helped shape Chinese thought',
    'Author': 'Martin Kern',
    'Date': '30 May 2018',
    'PosterUrl': 'p068pw87.jpg',
    'Body': `    <p>Since antiquity, no other text has enjoyed a presence quite like The Book of Songs –
    <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Book_of_Songs.html?id=5mTXnQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">in one critic’s words</a>, it is “the classic of the human heart and the human mind.” It is the first poetic anthology
    of China; Confucius himself is said to have compiled the “three hundred songs”—another early name for the text –
    out of a body of 3,000, “removing duplicates and choosing only what could be matched to the principles of ritual”.
    By the end of the Western Han dynasty (202 BCE-9 CE), there were no fewer than four schools of the Songsat the imperial
    academy, offering a range of different interpretations for each song.</p>
<p>In the same way that Homer’s epics took hold within the West, The Book of Songs played a role in spheres far beyond literature,
    with a lasting influence on Chinese civilisation. The collection had an impact on education, politics and communal
    life: in antiquity, the Songs were quoted and recited as coded communication in diplomatic exchange; invoked as proof
    to cap a philosophical argument; read as commentary – satirical more often than not – on historical circumstances;
    and taught for the purposes of moral edification. It has continued to affect Chinese society since then, both through
    what the Songs say and the form they take.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p> Many of the Court Hymns are grand, expansive narratives to celebrate the Zhou; they served as the dynasty’s core
        text of political and cultural memory </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The received anthology emerged from the “Mao tradition”, one of the four early schools, and is divided into four parts:
    160 Airs (
    <em>guofeng</em>), 74 Minor Court Hymns (
    <em>xiaoya</em>), 31 Major Court Hymns (
    <em>daya</em>), and 40 Eulogies (
    <em>song</em>). Within the Eulogies, the 31 Eulogies of Zhou are considered the oldest segment of the anthology, purportedly
    dating back to the very early years of the Western Zhou (1046-771 BCE) dynasty.</p>

<p>These hymns, all of them rather short, were performed in sacrifices to the Zhou royal ancestors: multimedia performances
    containing the aromatic offerings of meat, grain and alcohol; ritual music on drums and bells, wind and string instruments;
    dance to re-enact the military conquest of the previous Shang dynasty; and the solemn hymns by which the Zhou king
    praised his ancestors and requested their blessings in return. In short, Chinese poetry begins in religious ritual.</p>
<p>By accompanying rites, in turn, the Eulogies helped regulate social order. Respecting ‘heaven’s will’ was an important
    element of ancient Chinese politics; by enforcing this message, the Book of Songs could underpin the rule of the
    Zhou Dynasty. Unlike the Eulogies, many of the Court Hymns are grand, expansive narratives to celebrate the Zhou;
    they served as the dynasty’s core text of political and cultural memory. Like the archaic Eulogies, the Hymns are
    straightforward; there is no debate about the story they are meant to tell.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Confucius Confusion</strong>
</p>
<p>Far more challenging are the Airs of the States, assigned to 15 different regions roughly along the Yellow River across
    northern China. Not one of these songs carries a historical narrative. Some are deceptively easy on their surface:
    a song of desire, the parting song of lovers at dawn, a farmer’s protest against corrupt officials, the lament of
    a soldier on campaign longing for home, or of his wife waiting for him in vain. It is here where the human condition
    of thought and emotion finds its full expression – and where all questions of interpretation begin.</p>

<p>The May Fourth Movement of 1919 (anti-imperialist cultural and political protests sparked by students) tried to build
    a new national literary heritage on the ruins of an empire that after two millennia had finally collapsed. Now, the
    Airs became something new altogether: folk songs whose charming simplicity and repetitive diction seemed to have
    sprung directly from the hearts of the common people.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p> Like no other text from Chinese antiquity, the Songs were cherished, and hence survived, in two parallel traditions
        </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The very first and most famous Air of all, Fishhawks (Guanju), is known as a happy marriage song. Yet was it ever that?
    Already Zhu Xi (1130-1200) had advocated a return to the words of the songs themselves, in a veritable act of literary
    excavation after Han and later commentators had buried them under layers upon layers of learned commentary; and there
    is evidence that the poets – as opposed to the scholars – of imperial China always knew how to appreciate the Airs
    at face value, invoking their lively imagery taken from nature together with their expressions of desire, love, and
    pain.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Like no other text from Chinese antiquity, the Songs were cherished, and hence survived, in two parallel traditions:
    one of learned commentary and the imperial examination system, the other of poetic memory and allusion. Remarkably,
    no ancient source ever shows us the Airs as innocent folk poetry. Early imperial legend knows of royal officials
    “collecting” the songs from the “lanes and alleys” to reveal to the ruler the social conditions and sentiments of
    the common people; purportedly, only then were they adapted to court music. Yet there is nothing to support such
    pious belief in the folk origins of poetry; instead, every reference to, or quotation from, the Songs before and
    after the foundation of the empire in 221 BCE shows them as part of the élite curriculum that gradually solidified
    in the form of the Five Classics of imperial Confucianism.</p>
<p>In that tradition, each line could have multiple meanings. One Han commentary takes Fishhawks as praising the virtue
    of King Wen (1099-1050 BCE) and his wife; yet another takes it as criticism of King Kang (1005-978 BCE). And finally,
    several recently discovered tomb manuscripts on bamboo and silk, dating from the 4th through the 2nd Centuries BCE,
    note that “Fishhawks uses the expression of sexual allure and desire to illustrate propriety” in order to advance
    moral thought.</p>

<p>Through poetry, rites and music, Confucian education sought to teach moral subtleties – easily memorised in the form
    of singing, The&nbsp;Book of Songs&nbsp;helped to lay down rules for behaviour. Its poetry, as opposed to the Western
    tradition, was largely anonymous and apparently simple. Yet beneath the surface, the poems are multi-layered. To
    this day, the Songs – and especially the Airs – are speaking in multiple voices. In delightful ambiguity, they have
    survived every attempt to be reduced, and hence diminished, to a single message or meaning.</p>
<p>Listen to what the Confucius of the Analects had to say about them: the Songs “can be covered in one phrase: no wayward
    thoughts!”; with them, “one can inspire, observe, unite, and express resentment” as well as learn “in great numbers
    the names of fish, birds, beasts, plants, and trees”; those who fail to master them “have nothing to express themselves
    with” and are like a man who “stands with his face straight to the wall”.</p>
<p>And even those who can recite all of “the three hundred”: if you are unable to apply the poems flexibly creatively according
    to context, “what use is there for them?” In short, it was never about what the songs – all of them anonymous – originally
    meant, or where they came from. It was always about something else: how can you make them mean something new?</p>

    'Body': `<p>Although hardly unique in this regard, Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man shows how affirming the capacity of a work to speak
        to all times (or, at the very least, to our own time) might stand at odds with understanding that work in its own
        moment.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When Ellison’s novel, which chronicled the erratic journey of its unnamed protagonist from the segregated American South
        to New York City’s Harlem teetering on the brink of social upheaval, appeared in 1952, the United States was still
        a ‘Jim Crow’ nation. Although the rigour with which the dictates of this regime were enforced varied from time to
        time and place to place, the society in which Ellison came of age was one where openly discriminatory actions and
        policies had the sanction of both law and custom. In the years that Ellison wrote his novel, the political and social
        agitation and decisions in lower court cases that would lead to the US Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in Brown v
        Board of Education had already signalled that a major social change might be imminent. But the decision itself, which
        would declare unconstitutional the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’, was still a couple of years off.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Accordingly, Invisible Man took aim at the complex social, psychological and political assumptions and beliefs that enabled
        those in power to insist (and believe) that relegating the nation’s black population to second-class citizenship
        was not only compatible with justice but could also be accomplished without inflicting psychic damage on the perpetrators
        of discrimination themselves. If Invisible Man were to be any kind of novel at all, it would have to take on directly
        the nation’s moral evasions as they manifested at that moment. &nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p> If Ellison is a Jim Crow author, then he’s a man of our moment </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And the task of delineating the specific social types produced by that social system required historical precision. Shortly
        after learning of the Brown decision, Ellison expressed relief that he’d depicted Dr Bledsoe (the president of the
        novel’s Negro College, modelled on Tuskegee Institute – now Tuskegee University – who expels Invisible Man’s callow
        protagonist, thus beginning the young man’s humiliating, if ultimately enlightening, odyssey through the social landscape
        of black and radical America of the mid-20th Century) before social change had rendered Bledsoe’s social type obsolete.
        Accepting the demand of social relevance was to risk becoming old news.</p>

    <p>Old news, though, is hardly the phrase one associates with Invisible Man these days. It is true that during the 1970s
        heyday of Black Power and Black Arts, Ellison’s embrace of a Western cultural lineage for his art placed him at odds
        with many vocal partisans of the Black Aesthetic. Even so, some of his utterances from that period – for example
        his observation in his essay Society, Morality and the Novel that “it was the existence of human slavery and colonial
        exploitation which made possible many of the brighter achievements of modern civilisation” – now make him feel quite
        timely.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>That was then, this is now</strong>
    </p>
    <p>If Ellison is a Jim Crow author, then he’s a man of our moment, if we are to believe, as Michelle Alexander affirmed
        in her book, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colour-Blindness, that Jim Crow did not crumble under
        the assault of the civil rights victories of the 1950s and 1960s, but rather merely went underground. In doing so,
        it was perhaps like Ellison’s nameless protagonist, disappearing only to resurface in a different guise in the 1980s
        and 1990s through aggressive, racially targeted policing and sentencing, the goal of which was to reduce much of
        the US black population to a status verging on, if not identical with, that which blacks experienced from the 1890s
        through to the 1950s.</p>

    <p>This sense that we are not contending with a new set of social and political circumstances, but are rather, reexperiencing
        what’s already happened, has become pervasive in some quarters. In late 2011 when I consulted with the Court Theatre
        in Chicago on its world-premiere adaptation of Invisible Man for the stage, I realised that my role would not be,
        as is so often the case in adaptations, to figure out how to make this ‘classic’ text relevant to the present. Instead,
        out of what some might see as a misguided fealty to the concept of historical change, I tried to become a force of
        defamiliarisation: yes, the world we live in now was powerfully shaped by the society that produced the sensibilities
        of a writer like Ellison. But it is not a world in which a power-hungry college president can hold sway over a politically
        silenced black population.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ellison’s Bledsoe – who the protagonist affirms “was more than just a president of a college. He was a leader, a ‘statesman’
        who carried our problems to those above us, even unto the White House; and in days past he had conducted the president
        himself about the campus. He was our leader and our magic, who kept the endowment high, the fund for scholarships
        plentiful and publicity moving through the channels of the press” – is no longer a contemporary type. He was a creature
        of disfranchisement, a political fact that made a mere audience with a US president momentous and the possibility
        of becoming president sheer fantasy. Our world is not his. Nor is ours a world in which the notion of a ‘black community’,
        despite the frequency with which the term is used to describe the collective responses and wants of US blacks, can
        do anything but misrepresent a population that, as pointed out to me recently by the University of Illinois Chicago
        scholar Cedric Johnson, is larger than the entire nation of Canada.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p> &nbsp;It is virtually impossible to read about Tod Clifton and not be reminded of the 2014 death of Eric Garner </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In many ways, though, Invisible Man itself militates against its own possible obsolescence. Not only does Ellison’s narrator
        inveigh against those who assert the idea of linear progress or even the possibility that history can spiral upward,
        warning that “they are preparing a boomerang.&nbsp; Keep a steel helmet handy”, but many of the events that unfold
        in the novel seem eerily to foreshadow the present. It is virtually impossible to read about Tod Clifton being shot
        by a police officer for selling paper sambo dolls and not be reminded of the
        <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-30323750">2014 death of Eric Garner</a>. And the public demonstration organised by the invisible protagonist in protest of
        Clifton’s death seems a base layer of a palimpsest of innumerable such images that we as readers can now recall.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>All of this is furthered by the iterative structure of the plot in which each demoralising episode experienced by the
        narrator reveals itself as a version of the attempted dehumanisation of the protagonist that preceded it. The college
        president and the college ultimately become ‘Brother Jack and the Brotherhood’, thin disguises for the American Communist
        Party (although Ellison insisted otherwise). It was part of the project of the novel to impugn those who believed
        that through the proper application of ideology or discipline they could control human behaviour and events, and,
        accordingly, the plot works to reveal the narrator’s rather tenacious desire to believe the schemes foisted upon
        him as various forms of blindness.&nbsp;</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Yet, for all of its circularity and the fact that the novel ends (and begins) with its protagonist hiding underground
        in a hole illuminated by 1,369 light bulbs, contemplating a return to the surface where he still might play a socially
        responsible role, both it and its author, in his various commentaries on novel-writing, remained resolutely optimistic
        that the US might realise its dream of creating a just and democratic society and that novels could prove to be a
        useful tool in the process.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This belief pits Ellison against a prominent strain of thinking that currently prevails among many members of the black
        commentariat. Called ‘Afro-pessimism’, it holds that the very foundation of our idea of human rights and shared humanity
        depends on the negation of the world’s black people. Where Ellison saw contradiction between ideal and reality, Afro-pessimism
        sees an inexorable logic in which the very political, economic, and social means that seem most available for achieving
        a more just world turn out to be nothing more than reasserting a subjugation of a portion of the world’s population.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The point here would not be to find in Ellison’s novel remedies for what currently ails us. Rather, his work might provide
        a goad for acknowledging and interrogating the material processes and practices that got us from where Ellison was
        in the early 1950s to where we are now. It’s not that Ellison believed in the possibility of human or societal perfection.
        Perfection was the delusion of the authoritarian types that people Invisible Man. For Ellison it was quite the contrary.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In his essay on novel-writing, he speculated: “Perhaps the novel evolved in order to deal with man’s growing awareness
        that behind the facade of social organisations, manners, customs, myths, rituals and religions of the post-Christian
        era lies chaos”. Ellison believed that “In our time the most articulate form for defining ourselves and for asserting
        our humanity is in the novel. Certainly it is our most rational art form for dealing with the irrational.” The world
        was not perfectible, but through art and shared governance it could become profoundly human.</p>

    <p>“My prettiest contribution to the culture” was how the novelist Kurt Vonnegut described his old master’s thesis in anthropology,
        “which was rejected because it was so simple and looked like too much fun”. The thesis sank without a trace, but
        Vonnegut continued throughout his life to promote the big idea behind it, which was: “stories have shapes which can
        be drawn on graph paper”.</p>
    <p>In a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-84vuR1f90">1995 lecture</a>, Vonnegut chalked out various story arcs on a blackboard, plotting how the protagonist’s fortunes
        change over the course of the narrative on an axis stretching from ‘good’ to ‘ill’. The arcs include ‘man in hole’,
        in which the main character gets into trouble then gets out again (“people love that story, they never get sick of
        it!”) and ‘boy gets girl’, in which the protagonist finds something wonderful, loses it, then gets it back again
        at the end. “There is no reason why the simple shapes of stories can’t be fed into computers”, he remarked. “They
        are beautiful shapes.”</p>
    <p>"Thanks to new text-mining techniques, this has now been done.
        <a href="ttp://www.matthewjockers.net/2014/06/05/a-novel-method-for-detecting-plot/">Professor Matthew Jockers at the University of Nebraska</a>, and later researchers at the University of Vermont’s
        Computational Story Lab, analysed data from thousands of novels to reveal
        <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601848/data-mining-reveals-the-six-basic-emotional-arcs-of-storytelling/">six basic story types</a> – you could call them archetypes – that form the building blocks for more complex stories.
        The Vermont researchers describe the six story shapes behind more than 1700 English novels as:</p>
    <p>1. Rags to riches – a steady rise from bad to good fortune</p>
    <p>2. Riches to rags – a fall from good to bad, a tragedy</p>
    <p>3. Icarus – a rise then a fall in fortune</p>
    <p>4. Oedipus – a fall, a rise then a fall again</p>
    <p>5. Cinderella – rise, fall, rise</p>
    <p>6. Man in a hole – fall, rise</p>
    <p>The researchers used sentiment analysis to get the data – a statistical technique often used by marketeers to analyse
        social media posts in which each word is allocated a particular ‘sentiment score’, based on crowdsourced data. Depending
        on the lexicon chosen, a word can be categorised as positive (happy) or negative (sad), or it can be associated with
        one or more of eight more subtle emotions, including fear, joy, surprise and anticipation. For example, the word
        ‘happy’ is positive, and associated with joy, trust and anticipation. The word ‘abolish’ is negative and associated
        with anger.</p>
    <p>Do sentiment analysis on all the words in a novel, poem or play and plot the results against time, and it’s possible
        to see how the mood changes over the course of the text, revealing a kind of emotional narrative. While not a perfect
        tool – it looks at words in isolation, ignoring context – it can be surprisingly insightful when applied to larger
        chunks of text, as this

    <p>Dante’s tightly structured, exquisitely symmetrical epic poem traces his imaginary journey down into hell in the Inferno,
        accompanied by – who else? – the poet Virgil. Sure enough, things start off badly in the Divine Comedy with a low
        sentiment score that sinks further as the duo descend through the circles of hell. (There is a trace of ‘man in a
        hole’ here, which in this case is as literally true as things could be in such an allegorical text.) Having miraculously
        survived hell, they next climb the Mountain of Purgatory where the souls of the excommunicated, slothful and lustful
        reside, and Beatrice – Dante’s ideal woman – eventually replaces Virgil as his companion. The pair’s ascent into
        heaven in the Paradiso is marked by growing joy as the poet comprehends the true nature of virtue and his soul becomes
        one with “the Love which moves the sun and the other stars”.</p>

    <p>There’s a moment in Flaubert’s tale of a bored and faithless housewife where our protagonist Emma Bovary muses that,
        since her life so far has been so bad, the part still to be lived must surely be better.</p>
    <p>Not so. Emma embarks on failed, desperate love affairs that offer only brief respite from the grinding tedium of being
        an imaginative woman married to the world’s dullest man, mounts up catastrophic debts and finally, kills herself
        by drinking arsenic. Her grieving husband, after discovering her multiple infidelities, then dies too, and their
        now-orphaned daughter is sent to live with her grandmother, who also dies. The little girl goes to live with a poor
        aunt, who sends her to work in a cotton mill. It’s a textbook tragedy, driven with relentless focus towards the end
        goal of total downfall, and an utterly satisfying story.</p>

    <p>Romeo and Juliet is naturally considered to be a tragedy in line with Shakespeare’s own description, but when you analyse
        its sentiment the story appears closer to the Icarus shape: a rise, then a fall. After all, the boy must find the
        girl and fall in love with her before they both lose each other. The romantic peak happens around a quarter of the
        way through the play, in the famous balcony scene in which they declare their undying love for one another.</p>
    <p>It’s all downhill from there. Romeo kills Tybalt and flees, the Friar’s plan to smuggle Juliet out to join him provides
        a small bump of false hope to the drama, but once Juliet has drunk the potion nothing can prevent the final, still-searing
        tragedy.</p>

    <p>The first half of Austen’s sparkling novel is a fiesta of balls and high jinks (albeit restrained ones), witticisms and
        unserious marriage proposals from the likes of comical vicar Mr Collins. Things take a darker turn as Bingley leaves
        and Elizabeth starts to develop a dislike for Darcy (based on a misunderstanding, naturally). The novel’s sentiment
        pivots into decisively negative territory after his disastrous proposal, reaching its nadir as Lydia elopes with
        the untrustworthy Wickham. This, of course, is also Darcy’s opportunity to prove himself, which he does with dignity
        and aplomb, winning Elizabeth’s heart and ensuring a measured happy ending, in which everyone is slightly wiser than
        they were before.</p>

    <p>Shelley’s seminal novel tells the woeful tale of Victor Frankenstein’s Creature in Victor’s own words, as related by
        Captain Walton in a series of letters to his sister. At one point, the Creature gets to take over the narrative,
        making the novel a story within a story within a story. This is in fact a moment of respite in what is overall a
        downward trajectory from the happy description of his early life with which Victor opens his narrative, to the appalling
        ending. At a pivotal moment two thirds of the way through the novel, the Creature offers Victor a way out – make
        him a female companion. But Victor refuses. From this point on, his fate is sealed. “Remember, I shall be with you
        on your wedding-night”, threatens the Creature. And so it proves.</p>

    <p>The shortest story of them all, Hans Christian Andersen’s famous fairy tale also has the most complex structure, incorporating
        two man in a hole (or duck in a hole) sentiment arcs within an overall rags to riches narrative framework. That is,
        things get generally better for the duckling over the course of the story, but there are flashes of light and dark
        along the way: he hatches (yay!) but is bullied for being different (boo). He discovers he can swim better than the
        other ducks and experiences a premonition of affinity as a group of swans fly over (yay!), but then nearly dies in
        the winter cold (boo). He does become a swan eventually, in a way entirely foretold from the beginning. That’s the
        point, of course: “To be born in a duck's nest, in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched from
        a swan's egg.” The story ends on the highest of notes, with the swan-all-along crying that he “never dreamed of such
        happiness as this”.</p>

    'Body': `<p>Before One Hundred Years of Solitude, Latin America bore certain similarities to the imaginary place described in the first
    paragraph of the novel: “The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was
    necessary to point”. The continent, obviously, wasn’t a new place when Gabriel García Márquez wrote his acclaimed novel:
    the authors known as
    <em>Cronistas de Indias</em>, during the 15th and 16th Centuries, undertook the task of describing the land; they named unknown
    things while seeing them for the first time.</p>
<p>Many decades later, García Márquez embarked on a second Discovery of America. From his little studio in Mexico City, patiently
    composing on his typewriter, he reimagined the genesis of the continent and by doing so changed its future forever.
</p>
<p>During the second half of the 20th Century, Latin America went through a convulsive period. Some countries – such as Chile,
    Colombia and Mexico – were struggling with instability, dictatorships, and political violence. This led to abrupt and,
    for the most part, confusing social changes, including the Cuban Revolution, led by Ernesto Che Guevara and Fidel Castro.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When García Márquez was in the first stages of his immense saga, he became fascinated with the turn of events in Cuba. What
    struck him the most was the real possibility of a new order for countries in this hemisphere, far from the pressure and
    demands of the United States. Many intellectuals – Mario Vargas Llosa, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Simone de Beauvoir,
    among many others – shared García Márquez’s enthusiasm. However, in the ensuing years, most of them grew disappointed
    and distanced themselves from the Cuban model. But it’s undeniable that the revolution had a major impact on the tone
    of One Hundred Years of Solitude: it gave García Marquez hope for the fate of Latin America.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Weaving an epic</strong>
</p>
<p>Writing his masterpiece, nevertheless, wasn’t easy. At the time, he was living with Mercedes, his wife, and his two sons,
    Rodrigo and Gonzalo, in Mexico City. They had fled Colombia because García Márquez didn’t feel at ease with the right-wing
    government in his country. He was living abroad – before settling in Mexico City he spent time in Caracas, Paris and
    Barcelona – all while nurturing his ambition to become a world-renowned novelist. But the family struggled to survive
    on his low wage as an international correspondent for a number of Spanish-language magazines and newspapers. His previous
    books had been highly praised yet a commercial failure. García Márquez knew he had a great story, but he just couldn’t
    find the right path for the epic novel he had in mind.</p>

<p>There are many legends – which, throughout the course of his life, he never bothered to confirm or deny – about how he found
    inspiration and overcame the writer’s block that plagued him. I choose to believe the version I read in
    <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/gabriel-garcia-marquez-9780747594765/">Gerald Martin’s wonderful biography</a>: “He set out with his family for a beach vacation in Acapulco, a day’s drive
    south. Partway there, he stopped the car – a white 1962 Opel with a red interior – and turned back. His next work of
    fiction had come to him all at once. For two decades he had been pulling and prodding at the tale of a large family in
    a small village. Now he could envision it with the clarity of a man who, standing before a firing squad, saw his whole
    life in a single moment.”</p>
<blockquote>
    <p> He ignored reality and wrote – possessed by the characters that had been whispering their stories into his ears ever
        since he was a small child </p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Martin, Mercedes immediately cancelled the relaxing weekend away. They drove back to their house, and she told
    him to start writing. She would take care of the household expenses as long as he stayed focused on the new novel. And
    so he did: he ignored reality and wrote – possessed by the characters that had been whispering their stories into his
    ears ever since he was a small child – for a solid eight months.</p>

<p>What came after has been recounted ad nauseam. The saga of Macondo and the Buendía family immediately became a modern classic,
    often compared to the works of Cervantes and Shakespeare. “It’s the book that redefined not just Latin American literature
    but literature, period,”
    <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/12/gabriel-garcia-marquez-one-hundred-years-of-solitude-history">said Ilan Stavans</a>, the pre-eminent scholar of Latino culture in the United States, who claims to have read the book
    30 times. García Márquez was neither a historian nor a sociologist. He was a natural storyteller. I often saw him as
    a prism. He was able to converge an extraordinary amount of information and transform it into a new mythology. That is
    the craft of One Hundred Years of Solitude: he pulled from different sources to create an alternate, hyperbolic birth
    of Latin American culture. And by doing so, he reinterpreted its nature.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fact and fiction </strong>
</p>
<p>It would be impossible to list all the sources that configured that new universe. He took a large part from the legends he
    heard during his childhood in Aracataca, the small Colombian town where he was born. These are the basis of the Caribbean
    oral traditions that lie beneath the novel’s skin. Then, he read William Faulkner as well as Greek and pre-Hispanic myths.
    And, finally, he took inspiration from Colombia’s violent history from the 18th to 20th Centuries. All these stories
    came together and ripened in his extraordinary mind, only to emerge as a different body, built using a symbolism of its
    own.</p>

<p>Gabo – as his friends and family called him – also possessed the ability to tell these stories like no one had done before
    him. He borrowed the pace and rhythm from Vallenato, a traditional folk music from the city of Valledupar, which he combined
    with the tools of narrative journalism. García Márquez was also a fantastic reporter, and such skills are showcased in
    his prose. I had the opportunity to see him work when I started my career at the magazine Cambioin the late ’90s. As
    a young journalist in Colombia, I witnessed his supernatural ability to transform the trivialities of everyday life into
    magical tales.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p> The world García Marquez created is a magnifying mirror in which Latin America is able to see its flaws and its virtues
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>One Hundred Years of Solitude is a powerful allegory of the Latin American identity. The story, set in a time period of a
    century, explores many of the predominant issues in the region’s troubled history: caudillismo (the leadership of a ‘strongman’),
    machismo, rebellion, power, plagues, and political violence. But despite its dense social fabric, García Márquez unveils
    it with humour and in a refined, poetic language. And behind this somewhat conflicted social fresco, he was capable of
    seeing the beauty that lies in all of it. As he said
    <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1982/marquez-lecture.html">in his Nobel Prize lecture</a>: “In spite of this, to oppression, plundering and abandonment, we respond with life. Neither
    floods nor plagues, famines nor cataclysms, nor even the eternal wars of century upon century, have been able to subdue
    the persistent advantage of life over death.”</p>
<p>This portrait may seem like a caricature, but magical realism is built on exaggeration. The world García Marquez created
    is a magnifying mirror in which Latin America is able to see its flaws and its virtues. As he said in an interview with
    The New York Times in 1988: “I think my books have had political impact in Latin America because they help to create
    a Latin American identity; they help Latin Americans to become more aware of their culture.” And in this awareness lies
    its power.</p>

    Sandra Bullock as Debbie Ocean, sister of George Clooney’s Danny. Heists run in their family, as Debbie masterminds a
    girls’ group of thieves trying to purloin some jewels during the Met Gala.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>It turns out that Gary Ross’s style, or lack of it, is the uneven film’s major liability</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The real question, though, is why
    <em>this</em> male filmmaker, Gary Ross? It turns out that the female version of the story was his idea, so he directed and
    wrote (with Olivia Milch). It also turns out that his style, or lack of it, is the uneven Ocean’s major liability.</p>
<p>Ross’ career is loaded with popcorn movies no better than they have to be, such as&nbsp; Pleasantville, Seabiscuit and the
    first Hunger Games, which got by on the strength of Jennifer Lawrence. The all-star cast in Ocean’s 8 – which includes
    Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling, Rihanna and Anne Hathaway – creates some comic highlights. The film is never less than
    breezy entertainment, but never more than an unimaginative diversion. Ross brings a safe, pedestrian approach to a genre
    that should be crackling with wit and zooming through an intricate plot faster than the audience can guess what’s coming.</p>
<p>The story is based on the sexist premise that women thieves – and by implication women viewers – are all about fancy clothes
    and jewels. That superficial idea is laid over the standard Ocean’s blueprint. Beneath her cute name, Debbie is a hardened
    con woman who has spent five years in prison working out a foolproof plan: to make sure that a Hollywood star (Hathaway,
    convincing as an especially self-absorbed swan) wears a $150 million (£112m) Cartier necklace to the ball, unaware of
    the plot to lift it from her neck.</p>
<p>As in the three Las Vegas-set Ocean’s movies directed by Steven Soderbergh, this one spends some time lining up the team.
    The results are surprisingly erratic, depending on each actress’ effectiveness at spinning the script into something
    better.</p>
<p>Kaling’s scenes all work, as she brings perfect comic delivery to the role of a jeweller whose small family business keeps
    her living in her mother’s house. Helena Bonham-Carter displays a madcap energy as a has-been fashion designer who owes
    $5 million (£3.73m) to the IRS. Rihanna has relatively little to say, but it’s amusing to see her play against type,
    wearing coveralls and scruffy work boots as a hacker so good she can tap into the Met’s security system.</p>
<p>And Bullock glides effortlessly through the story, holding it together. Debbie doesn’t reveal much of a personality, but
    she does have a few good lines. “Somewhere out there is an eight-year-old girl dreaming of becoming a criminal,” she
    tells her crew on the night of the gala. “Do this for her.” The film could have used so much more of that acerbic tone,
    or really any consistent tone.</p>
<p>Sarah Paulson is wasted as a suburban mother, a one-time fence who misses the kick of being an outlaw. The biggest shock
    is how subdued and uninteresting Cate Blanchett is. Her character, a club owner named Lou, is all about an androgynous
    David Bowie swagger, from her name to her blonde wig to the green-sequined jumpsuit she wears to the ball. The script
    plants a bit of sexual innuendo into Lou’s relationship with Debbie, but in the end her character is the most cardboard
    of all. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong>An empty vault</strong>
</p>
<p>At times the film feels like a tourist ad for New York City, as Debbie cases the Metropolitan Museum of Art and wanders through
    its galleries, Modigliani and Van Gogh paintings in the background. Many brand names are on display, with a couple of
    forays into Cartier’s and a quick visit to the Vogue magazine offices. Many casinos got free publicity in the Soderbergh
    Ocean’s movies; then as now the tactic does less to enhance authenticity than to call attention to the built-in advertising.</p>
<p>And the parade of high fashion on the night of this fictional Met Gala misses the wit and fun of the real thing, which has
    become not a display of elegance but of over-the-top, sometimes hilarious bravado. For this year’s Catholic-themed ball,
    Rihanna wore a comic masterpiece, a takeoff on the Pope’s wardrobe, with a silvery beaded mitre to match her minidress
    and coat. The on-screen Met Ball takes its fashion ultra-seriously, a lost opportunity in a film meant to be funny.</p>
<p>The dressed-down moments actually have the most life. Kaling, dressed as the kitchen help, locks herself in a Met ladies
    room and surreptitiously dismantles a necklace. James Corden turns up eventually as an insurance investigator, who happily
    is not a bumbling cliché, and instantly energises the story.</p>
<p>Throughout, the movie teases the idea that Danny Ocean is dead. Or is that another of his long cons? The unstated tease,
    of course, is the possibility that Clooney will show up. As with all things in Ocean’s 8, it’s best to approach this
    with lowered expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A successful woman-centric comedy, like Bridesmaids, plays off rituals different from men’s. A failure like the latest Ghostbusters
    proves that just subbing female characters into a franchise is never enough. And considering what a truly creative filmmaker
    – anyone from Soderbergh to Greta Gerwig – might have done, it’s frustrating that this Ocean’s is so timid. Why bother
    rebooting a franchise if you’re not going to break the mould, at least a little?&nbsp;</p>`

    'Body': `    <p>Japanese voice-over actress Yūko Nagashima was a little worried when she first took on the job of providing Carrie Bradshaw’s
    voice in dubbed versions of the US television phenomenon Sex and the City. Sex, after all, was not something Japanese
    women discussed openly, nonchalantly, like Carrie and her friends do at any given brunch. “I wondered how it would
    sit with a more reserved Japanese audience,” Nagashima
    <a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2010/06/07/the-japanese-voice-of-sex-the-city/">told The Wall Street Journal</a>
    <em>.</em> “But I quickly realised that Sex and the City touches on common issues women worry about, like love, sex,
    their partners, their careers, etc. These issues are universal to all women, regardless of where they are from, and
    I think this is why it also appeals to Japanese women.”</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The show made it okay for Japanese women to say the word for “sex” – sekkusu – out loud</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nagashima would go on to voice Carrie throughout the series, as well as the two film follow-ups. And Japan wasn’t the
    only country outside the US hungry for every bit of Sex and the City it could get.</p>

<p>Now, as Sex and the City celebrates the 20th anniversary of its premiere, it remains as large a global force as ever,
    continuing to air in re-runs and streaming, and leaving its mark on entire industries – the series granted international
    renown to Manolo Blahnik shoes, Magnolia Bakery cupcakes and plenty of other name brands. Yet its success has been
    particularly surprising in more conservative Asian and Middle Eastern countries, where it has been celebrated, imitated
    and banned – but never met with indifference.</p>

<p>Sex and the City’s sense of freedom has been a particular draw for Japanese women since it was first exported there in
    1999. The show made it okay for Japanese women to say the word for “sex” –
    <em>sekkusu</em> – out loud,

<p>“In Japan it was very powerful because young women were finding their voice and being more demanding in relationships,”
    Veronica Chambers, author of Kickboxing Geishas: How Modern Japanese Women Are Changing Their Nation, told me for
    my own book,
    <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Sex-and-the-City-and-Us/Jennifer-Keishin-Armstrong/9781501164828">Sex and the City and Us</a>
    <em>.</em> The fairytale aspect of the four women looking for their own charming princes resonated, she said, but so
    did their freedom with fashion at a time when the Japanese Harajuku movement was pioneering its own boundary-pushing
    looks.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Cupcakes and criticism</strong>
</p>
<p>Other trends from the show spread quickly in its Asian markets as well. Magnolia Bakery, the New York-based chain that
    launched the cupcake trend, expanded to Japan and South Korea, as well as several Middle Eastern countries thanks
    to its appearance on Sex and the City in 2000. As of last year, the Korean location still credited 70 percent of
    its sales to cupcakes.</p>

<p>Even later in the 2000s, when the two Sex and the City movies came out, its independent and brash heroines continued
    to speak directly to Japanese women. “These qualities seem to fascinate the women of Japan, who are still burdened
    with the pressure of having to act like meek and fragile dolls, willing to bow politely (and give up seats graciously)
    to men who will one day ‘honour’ them with marriage,” Trenton Truitt wrote in
    <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/features/opinions/sex-and-this-city">Japan Today</a>. “Constantly pressured by parents and society to find a husband lest they bear the shame of becoming
    a ‘make-inu’ (loser dog), Japanese women connect with the relationship struggles on the show. They are fixated on
    finding their own Mr Big, which in the end seems as difficult in Tokyo as it is in Manhattan.”</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Trashing Sex and the City in Japan is like admitting to years of celibacy – Kaori Shoji</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Japan, the Sex and the City franchise remains at least as closely associated with womanhood as it is in the United
    States. “Trashing Sex and the City is like saying you don’t own one pair of great strap-on heels or a little black
    dress,” Kaori Shoji wrote in a critical 2008 review of the Sex and the City movie
    <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2008/08/15/films/film-reviews/sex-and-the-city/#.WuIo6NPwZsM">in The Japan Times</a>. “It’s like admitting to years of celibacy. Immediately, you’re seen as less than a woman
    (the modern definition of one anyway), one with no sense, no taste, weird and undesirable. I can already hear the
    gates of sisterhood crashing in my face with a resounding, hostile bang.”</p>

<p>In some other countries, including Singapore, the US version was banned. As the series began to air across the world
    in 1999, the conservative island kept the show from its airwaves until 2004. High demand – and some changes in media
    laws – allowed a slightly cleaned-up version to start airing around the time the series finale was airing in the
    US, with sex scenes and expletives excised. Still, it broke down barriers, keeping some of the saucy brunch banter
    and gay themes intact. HBO played down the sexiness in Singaporean ads, using the tagline, “Love is always worth
    the wait.”</p>

<p>The show remained taboo in some regions even years later. In the 2010 film Sex and the City 2, the characters vacation
    in Abu Dhabi, and producers hoped to shoot in nearby Dubai as a close approximation to the conservative capital of
    the United Arab Emirates. But even Dubai officials
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/18/sex-and-the-city-2-abu-dhabi">denied them permission after reading the script</a>, which includes sexpot Samantha throwing condoms at men in a
    marketplace and a line about a potential lover being “the Lawrence of my labia.” They had to settle for Morocco instead.
    The film was never screened in the UAE, though officials there
    <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/uae/uae-watchdog-denies-banning-sex-and-the-city-2-1.586656">said the distributor never applied for clearance, likely because of concerns that it would suffer from too many censoring
        cuts</a>.</p>

<p>More recently, China got its own Sex and the City imitator,
    <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2105913/chinese-sex-and-city-confronting-awkward-truths-china">a drama called Ode to Joy</a>. It centres on five urban women and their love lives, confronting taboo sexual issues;
    one character upset her boyfriend with her admission that she wasn’t a virgin. Of course, that sounds beyond tame
    by US Sex and theCity standards, but that’s just the point: the format has allowed culturally specific stories about
    women to be truthfully told. And if their taboo is virginity, even a Samantha would have to applaud them.</p>

    'Body': `    <p>In 1958, Tony Curtis was at a Hollywood party when Billy Wilder took him aside. Wilder was planning a film about two
    musicians who dress up as women to join an all-girl band, and he asked Curtis to play one of the musicians. Curtis
    was overjoyed, but he wasn’t sure why such an illustrious writer-director would want to use him. “You’re the handsomest
    kid in this town,” said Wilder. “Who else am I going to use?”</p>

<p>Faced with the question of why Some Like It Hot has topped BBC Culture’s poll of the best ever big-screen comedies, it’s
    tempting to say something similar. Wilder’s glittering masterpiece doesn’t just use the handsomest kid in town (and
    a terrific actor, to boot), but its most radiant sex symbol, Marilyn Monroe, and one of its most dexterous comedians,
    Jack Lemmon. It also has a bevy of bathing beauties, a crowd of sinister mafiosi, a glamorous seaside setting in
    the roaring ‘20s, and a sizzling selection of songs.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p> It’s an anthem in praise of tolerance, acceptance, and the possibility of transformation. It’s an anthem that we
        need to hear now more than ever </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is structured so meticulously that it glides from moment to moment with the elegance of an Olympic figure skater,
    and the consummate screwball dialogue, by Wilder and IAL Diamond, is so polished that every line includes either
    a joke, a double meaning, or an allusion to a line elsewhere in the film. To quote one character, it’s a riot of
    “spills, thrills, laughs and games”. To quote another, it deserves to be “the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin”.
    So why was it chosen as the best comedy ever made? Simple. What else were we going to choose?</p>

<p>There’s more to Some Like It Hot than its sparkling surface, though. As well as being a romantic comedy, a buddy movie,
    a crime caper, and a musical, the film is an anthem in praise of tolerance, acceptance, and the possibility of transformation.
    It’s an anthem that we need to hear now more than ever.</p>
<p>Wilder borrowed the basic set-up from a French farce, Fanfare d’amour (1935), and a remake, Fanfaren der Liebe (1951),
    which he dismissed as “a very low-budget, very third-class German picture”. Its heroes are Joe (Curtis) and Jerry
    (Lemmon), a saxophonist and a bassist who are scraping a living in freezing Chicago when they witness 1929’s St Valentine’s
    Day Massacre – or a version of that legendary event at least.</p>

<p>Desperate to elude the city’s most ruthless gangster, Spats Colombo (George Raft), they disguise themselves as Josephine
    and Daphne (“I’ve never liked the name Geraldine,” explains Jerry), so that they can hide in a Florida hotel for
    three weeks with a female jazz orchestra, Sweet Sue’s Society Syncopators. On the southbound sleeper train, they
    are both smitten by the band’s voluptuous ukulele player, Sugar Kane (Monroe). She tells Joe/Josephine that she is
    hoping to seduce a millionaire in Florida, so when the band arrives at the Seminole-Ritz Hotel (actually the Hotel
    del Coronado in San Diego), he switches to another disguise. Stealing some clothes from the band’s manager, and stealing
    his accent from Cary Grant, he styles himself as Junior, heir to the Shell Oil fortune.</p>
<p>One of the film’s many twists is that when Sugar meets Junior on the beach, he doesn’t throw himself at her. He plays
    hard to get. Sugar tells him that her band specialises in hot jazz, but he sniffs, “Well, I guess some like it hot.
    But personally, I prefer classical music.” Sugar doesn’t miss a beat. She claims to have “spent three years at the
    Sheboygan Conservatory of Music” - a claim she overheard Joe/Josephine making the previous night. “Good school,”
    murmurs Joe/Junior. Sugar, he realises, is just as adept at lying as he is.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jerry/Daphne has been inveigled into going out with an elderly - and presumably short-sighted - tycoon, Osgood
    (Joe E Brown), and their enchanted evening ends with another twist: in the morning, an elated Jerry tells Joe that
    he and Osgood are engaged. Joe protests that there are “laws, conventions” that have to be observed. But when Jerry
    finally admits to his fiancé that he is a man, Osgood responds with the film’s exemplary last line, “Well, nobody’s
    perfect.”</p>
<p>
    <strong>‘Sweet’ or ‘hot’</strong>
</p>
<p>In summary, Some Like It Hot is the story of people who lie and cheat in order to con other people into bed or out of
    their cash. Wilder has a reputation for dark, cynical films (see also Sunset Boulevard and Double Indemnity), and
    Some Like It Hot could be categorised as one of them. But it has so much warmth that it carries the viewer upwards
    like a hot-air balloon. Rather than condemning its unscrupulous anti-heroes, it respects them and sympathises with
    them in a way which must have seemed radical in 1959, and which seems more radical nearly six decades later.</p>

<p>Just imagine how the film’s scenario would be treated in a Hollywood comedy today. Joe and Jerry would be punished for
    their deceit. Sugar would have to catch Joe out, and he would have to apologise, and the viewer would have to sit
    through a montage of their shared misery before she forgave him. He and Jerry would then use their talent for duplicity
    to extract a confession from Spats Colombo. And, of course, Jerry and Osgood’s heterosexuality would be vigorously
    reaffirmed. Think of Judd Apatow’s comedies, for example. They all conclude that it’s amusing for “laws, conventions”
    to be flouted for a while, just as long as they’re put firmly back in place before the end credits roll.</p>

<p>Some Like It Hot is too buoyant to be brought down to earth by such prissiness. When Sugar learns that Joe has been tricking
    her, she runs straight into his arms. When Osgood learns that Jerry has been tricking him, he doesn’t bat an eyelid.
    The message is that there is nothing wrong with faking it until you make it. Experimenting with a new identity can
    help you become a better, happier person. It can help you survive. And, if you’re lucky, you’ll find someone who
    accepts you for whomever you want to be - perfect or otherwise.</p>
<p>It’s a boldly inclusive message, but it’s one that must have been close to the film-makers’ hearts. After all, several
    of them had reinvented themselves, just as the characters do: emigrating from Germany (in Wilder’s case) and Romania
    (in Diamond’s), distancing themselves from their hardscrabble pasts in Californian foster homes (in Monroe’s case)
    and on the streets of the Bronx (in Curtis’s). For a frantic farce about two cross-dressers on the run from prohibition-era
    mobsters, Some Like It Hot is a strikingly personal, even semi-autobiographical film.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p> Not even Twelfth Night or The Importance of Being Earnest had such elaborate fun with its characters’ identities
        </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look again at the beach scene with Joe and Sugar. It was written by two men who were once called Samuel Wilder and Itec
    Domnici, and acted by a man and a woman who were once called Bernie Schwartz and Norma Jeane Mortenson. Schwartz,
    who renamed himself Tony Curtis, is playing Joe, who is pretending to be Junior, using the mid-Atlantic vowels of
    Cary Grant, who was once called Archibald Leach. Mortenson, who renamed herself Marilyn Monroe, is playing Sugar
    Kowalczyk, who renamed herself Sugar Kane, and who is using lines which Joe used when he was pretending to be Josephine.
    Not even Twelfth Night or The Importance of Being Earnest had such elaborate fun with its characters’ identities.
    Names, genders, social standings ... they can all change in Some Like It Hot. It’s the American way.</p>
<p>In Curtis’s memoir about the making of the film, he confirms that Wilder and Diamond embedded this theme in its title.
    People, he argues, can be as fluid as the pop songs of the 1920s, which were performed in different styles - either
    “sweet” or “hot” - according to the audience’s preference. “The concept was important to our movie,” writes Curtis.
    “A person can be more than one thing, depending on the time, the place, whatever. Sweet or hot.”</p>
